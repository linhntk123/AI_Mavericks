# KMNIST Optimizer Comparison Project

## Introduction

This project compares the performance of three popular optimization algorithms—Adam, RMSprop, and AdamW—on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the Kuzushiji-MNIST (KMNIST) dataset.

## Dataset Description

The KMNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of cursive Japanese (Kuzushiji) characters. It consists of:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
Each image is 28x28 pixels and belongs to one of ten classes representing different Kuzushiji characters.

## Project Structure

- `midterm_project.ipynb`: Notebook containing the code and results.
- `README.md`: This file with instructions on setting up and running the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `accuracy_comparison.png`: Graphical visualization of the results.

## Setup and Execution

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoz-efa/Advanced-Deep-Learning-AIGC-5500-0NA-Midterm-Project.git
cd Advanced-Deep-Learning-AIGC-5500-0NA-Midterm-Project
```

### Install Required Packages

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Jupyter Notebook

To reproduce the results, run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
Colab notebook
```

Open `midterm_project.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially.
