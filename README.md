# KMNIST Optimizer Comparison Project

## Introduction

This project compares the performance of three popular optimization algorithms—Adam, RMSprop, and AdamW—on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the Kuzushiji-MNIST (KMNIST) dataset.

## Dataset Description

The KMNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of cursive Japanese (Kuzushiji) characters. It consists of:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
Each image is 28x28 pixels and belongs to one of ten classes representing different Kuzushiji characters.

## Project Structure

- `AI_Mavericks_ADL_Midterm.ipynb`: Notebook containing the code and results.
- `README.md`: This file with instructions on setting up and running the project.
